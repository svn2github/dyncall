TODO:
- check win32 expat binary installation
- demo(ttf) failed on Mac OS X 10.6
- callbacks should fail with "not yet implemented" on platforms
- use raw vectors for 1-to-1 bit encoding of values e.g. raw(8) for (u)int64 values
- handling of Csingle attribute on double vectors
- character encoding support, R supports UTF-8.
- Fortran calling conventions
- attr("struct") -> attr("CType")
- parseStructInfos -> cstruct
- parseUnionInfos -> cunion
- .dyncall typed pointer
- as.struct -> as.ctype
- new.struct -> cdata
- new.callback -> cfunction
- planed ports:glut, curl, openal    
- C++ proxies

BUGS:
- OpenBSD 4.8/amd64: SDL failed due to pthread.
  R version on OpenBSD does not provide a shared R library, thus
  the symbols are not resolvable.
  Additional Test for resolving self:
  While .dynsym(as.extptr(NULL), "R_ShowMessage") works on Mac OS X, it fails on OpenBSD.
