* PowerPC/Mac OS X 10.4: Building Universal Binaries are broken.. in particular 
  the as for i386 assembler. 
  Workaround for PowerPC users: install with "--no-multiarch" or use prebuilt 
  binaries built on OS X >= 10.5.

* SPARC Assembly sources are currently implemented for GNU assembler and do 
  not assemble using the 'fbe' Assembler tool on Solaris.
