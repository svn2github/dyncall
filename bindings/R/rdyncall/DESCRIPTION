Title: Dynamic C Library Binding Framework with a flexible Foreign Function Interface (FFI) (includes cross-platform bindings to OpenGL)
Author: Daniel Adler <dadler@uni-goettingen.de>
Maintainer: Daniel Adler <dadler@uni-goettingen.de>
Depends: R (>= 2.7)
Description: The FFI supports all fundamental C types, multiple calling conventions, handling of struct/union C data types and wrapping of R functions as C callback function pointers. 
  The Binding Framework offers to bind C Libraries to R via dynamically created name spaces comprising thin wrappers to the C Interface using a portable binding specification format.
  The package comes with an initial repository of portable bindings to libraries such as OpenGL, glew, OpenCL and SDL. 
  Users are enabled to develop system-level software with R using APIs such as OpenGL directly in R, portable across platforms.
