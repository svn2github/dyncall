Title: Improved Foreign Function Interface (FFI) and Dynamic Binding Framework for C shared libraries and APIs (including portable bindings to OpenGL and SDL).
Author: Daniel Adler <dadler@uni-goettingen.de>
Maintainer: Daniel Adler <dadler@uni-goettingen.de>
Depends: R (>= 2.7)
Description: The package extends R with dynamic interoperability facilities to foreign code. At core, an improved Foreign Function Interface with support for the full range of C types is provided that does extended type-safety checks. Transparent symbolic access to struct/union aggregate C types are supported as well, enabling R as a system-level programming language portable across all major platforms. In addition, wrapping of R functions into C callbacks is offered as well. At the highest abstraction, a dynamic binding framework provides direct access to C library APIs via R wrapper name spaces - dynamically created from portable type information - with an initial repository of ready-to-use bindings to OpenGL, Expat and SDL.
