Title: Dynamic Binding of C Libraries using a flexible Foreign Function Interface (FFI)
Author: Daniel Adler <dadler@uni-goettingen.de>
Maintainer: Daniel Adler <dadler@uni-goettingen.de>
Depends: R (>= 2.7)
Description: Dynamic C Library Binding and wrapping of APIs Foreign Library Interface framework for binding C Libraries and APIs to R via dynamically created R name space wrappers using a portable binding specification format.
  The FFI supports all fundamental C types, multiple calling conventions, handling of struct/union C data types and wrapping of R functions into C callback function pointers. 
  Bindings for a particular C Library and API can be extracted from C header files which are usually valid across platforms and stored in a compact plain text file format.
  An initial repository of portable bindings to common libraries such as OpenGL, SDL, Expat, etc.. is delivered with the package.
  This package enables developers to write system-level software by working with mapped C APIs to R name spaces.
