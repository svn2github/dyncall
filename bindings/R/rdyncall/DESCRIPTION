Title: Flexible Foreign Function Interface (FFI) to precompiled code and Dynamic Binding Framework for C shared libraries and APIs featuring portable bindings to SDL and OpenGL.
Author: Daniel Adler <dadler@uni-goettingen.de>
Maintainer: Daniel Adler <dadler@uni-goettingen.de>
Depends: R (>= 2.7)
Description: An improved and portable FFI with support for all fundamental C types, several calling conventions, argument type-safety checks, handling of C pointer-, struct- and union-types and wrapping of R functions into C callbacks. The binding framework enables dynamic loading of C libraries. Bindings are specified using a portable text format. The package is delivered with an initial repository of bindings to shared C libraries such as SDL, OpenGL and Expat. 
	The package enables system-level programming in R to certain degree without the need for additional compilation of extension C code.
