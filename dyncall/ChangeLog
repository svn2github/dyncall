  o numerous convenience changes to dynload interface (thanks Olivier)
  o added support for resolving application images itself
dyncall updates:
  o new platform support: arm/iphone (armv6), x86/Plan9
  o new mips calling conventions: oabi, n64 (both endian models)
  o cleanup: unexported functions in MASM files, b/c export not needed (thanks Olivier)

o added non-EABI ABI for arm32 (before, EABI was the default implementation)
o added dyncallback support for x64/windows (thanks Olivier), x64/darwin, arm32/arm, arm32/thumb
o synced documentation again with current state of the source (lots of small changes)
o updated ruby binding to current state of signature string (still some features missing, though)
o added a couple of new options to configure scripts (e.g. prefix-bd, new targets, etc.)
