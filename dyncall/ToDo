dynload:
--------
- do we need Dbghelp on windows?
  * if so, update gmake, etc... to link Dbghelp.lib
  * if not, get rid of the DbgHelp.lib link in test/nm
- rename SymsInit to InitSyms and similar for cleanup function to reflect naming
  in dyncall

urgent issues:
--------------
- get rid of # in .S files, Plan9 cpp (and possibly other cpps) get confused
- update: microsoft visual c++ build files - integrate all test suites in solution file
- test arm32/ATPCS/THUMB (and then change Status in doc Appendix)
- look over code and fix TODO or @@@ marks
- add MIPS callbacks
- finish PPC32 callbacks
- consider moving bindings into dyncall/ such that releases include it in the future
- add note to documentation, that bindings are svn-only ATM
- add pcc-support to doc
- check why the iyonix, etc. platforms have been taken out of 'configure'
- rename configure to configure.sh (so we would have .sh, .rc and .bat in the future)
- not sure, but configure(.sh) --tool-xxx might overwrite --asm-xxx, in some cases

nice to have:
-------------
- maybe rename DC__Arch_PowerPC to ...PPC32 for coherency reasons (...PPC64)?
- consistency: on x64 platforms: make both ABIs available ('win64','sysv') for all x64 OS ports
- dynamic choice of ARM/THUMB mode - ATM one has to compile for ARM or THUMB
- microsoft build enhancement: autodetect assembly via C preprocessor (like with .S gcc files)
- enhancement: state-machine error reporting (stack overflow and invalid mode)? (e.g. dcError() )

bugs:
-----
- vararg function calls don't work for PPC32 System V ABI
- vararg function calls don't work for ARM THUMB mode
