\section{Calling Conventions}

\paragraph{Before we go any further\ldots}

It is of {\bf great} importance to be aware that this section isn't a general
purpose description of the present calling conventions.
It merely explains the calling conventions {\bf for the parameter/return types
supported by \dc}, not for aggregates (structures, unions and classes), SIMD
data types (\_\_m64, \_\_m128, \_\_m128i, \_\_m128d), etc\ldots\\
We strongly advise the reader not to use this document as a general purpose
calling convention reference.
