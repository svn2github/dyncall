cross-compile for PSP using PSP-SDK
===================================

Make sure the psp-sdk is installed and that the build tools (e.g. psp-gcc) are
in your PATH. Also make sure that CPATH is set so that the psp-sdk's elf.h
can be found.

To build, use Makefile.embedded (see below) - no need to use ./configure.

build:
  
  CPATH=/usr/local/lib/gcc/psp/4.6.2/plugin/include/config/mips/elf.h CC=psp-gcc make -f Makefile.embedded
