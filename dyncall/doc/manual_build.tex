\section{Building the library}

The library has been built and used successfully on several 
platform/architecture configurations and build systems.
@@@ Please see notes on specfic platforms to check that the target
architecture is currently supported.


\subsection{Requirements}

The following tools are supported directly to build the \product{dyncall} library.
However, as the number of source files to be compiled for a given
platform is small, it shouldn't be difficult to build it manually with
another toolchain.
\begin{itemize}
\item C compiler to build the \product{dyncall} library (GCC or Microsoft C/C++ compiler)
\item C++ compiler to build the optional test cases (GCC or Microsoft C/C++ compiler)
\item Python (optional - for generation of some test cases)
\item BSD make, GNU make, or Microsoft nmake as automated build tools
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Supported/tested platforms and build systems}

Although it is possible to build the \product{dyncall} library on more platforms
than the ones outlined here, this section doesn't list operating systems or
architectures the authors didn't test. However, untested platforms using
the same build tools (e.g. the BSD family of operating systems using similar
flavors of the BSD make utility along with GCC, etc.) should work without
modification. If you have problems building the \product{dyncall} library on one of the
platforms mentioned below, or if you successfully built it on a yet unlisted
one, please let us know.\\

\subsection{Build instructions}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Configure the sources
\begin{lstlisting}
./configure [install-prefix-path] # on unix shell
.\configure [ x86 | x64 ]         # on windows shell
\end{lstlisting}
\item Build the static libraries \product{dyncall} and \product{dynload}
\begin{lstlisting}
make                              # using {GNU,BSD} Make
nmake /f Nmakefile                # using NMake on Windows
\end{lstlisting}
\item Install libraries and includes
\begin{lstlisting}
make install 
\end{lstlisting}
\item Optionally, build the test suites (Python required)
\begin{lstlisting}
make test
name /f Namekfile test
\end{lstlisting}
\end{enumerate}
