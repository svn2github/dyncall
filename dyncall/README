dyncall
=======

The dyncall library provides a portable way to call C functions in a completely
dynamic manner. In other words, instead of calling a function directly, the
dyncall library provides a mechanism to push the function parameters manually
and to issue the call afterwards.

Please refer to http://www.dyncall.org, dyncall(3), the dyncall manual and
platform-specific READMEs under doc/ for more information.
